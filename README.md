In this project, we will focus on the application of text mining in the consumer complaints for classification. We rely on the "Consumer Complaints" dataset accessible through the link https://data.world/data-society/consumer-complaint-data to analyze consumer complaints. The analysis of these textual data helps uncover the main issues, terms or expressions commonly used by consumers in their complaints, and the various aspects that impact their satisfaction and trust. Two models were creatd using SVM algorithm one using feature selection with Mutual information and the other with genetic algorithm
(Initially, I looked into the "Issue" and "Product" columns, but the results were not as accurate as desired. Subsequently, I shifted my focus to the "Consumer Complaint Narrative" column, which turned out to be more effective in improving the accuracy of our analysis. )
